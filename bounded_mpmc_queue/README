C implementation of Dmitry Vyukov's bounded multi-producer multi-consumer queue
using gcc atomic builtins.

The mpmc_queue_generic.h is a single header file which can be used when you need
type specific queue implementation using the MPMC_QUEUE_DECLARE(prefix, type) macro.
One example of how to use it would be the int_mpmc_queue.c and int_mpmc_queue.h
files for a queue of ints. The apis are documented in the header file. [-std=c99].
